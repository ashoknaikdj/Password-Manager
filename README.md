# Password-Manager


Project Statement: Password Manager
Description: Develop a secure password manager that allows users to store and retrieve their passwords for different accounts.
Implementation: Use Java to build a command-line or GUI-based application that encrypts and securely stores user passwords, providing
functionality for retrieval when needed.
The goal of this project is to develop a secure password manager that allows users to store and retrieve their passwords for different accounts.
The password manager will be implemented using Java and can be either a command-line or GUI-based application. The passwords will be
encrypted and securely stored to ensure the safety and privacy of the user's sensitive information.
Requirements:
User Registration:
The application should provide a user registration feature where new users can create an account by providing a username and a master
password. The master password will be used to encrypt and decrypt the stored passwords.
User Login:
Once registered, users should be able to log in to the password manager using their username and master password combination.
Password Storage:
The application should allow users to store passwords for their various accounts. Each stored password should be associated with a label or
identifier to indicate the account it belongs to (e.g., "Gmail," "Facebook," "Bank Account," etc.). The passwords should be encrypted before being
stored in the application's database or file system.
Password Retrieval:
Users should be able to retrieve their stored passwords by providing the associated account label or identifier. The application should decrypt the
password and display it to the user.
Password Generation:
The password manager should provide a feature to generate strong and secure passwords. The user can specify the desired length and
complexity of the password (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters) and the application will generate a random password that
meets the criteria.
Encryption:
The passwords stored in the application should be encrypted using a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
The encryption key should be derived from the user's master password.
Security Measures:
The application should implement security measures to protect against potential threats, such as brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and
password guessing. This can include techniques like password salting, hashing, and enforcing strong password policies.
User Interface:
If a GUI-based application is chosen, the user interface should be intuitive and easy to use. It should provide clear options for registration, login,
password storage, retrieval, and password generation.
Error Handling:
The application should handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user in case of incorrect login credentials,
database/file access issues, or other potential errors.
Testing:
Thoroughly test the application to ensure its functionality, security, and usability. Write test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases,
such as handling incorrect passwords, testing encryption and decryption, and validating password generation.
Documentation:
Provide clear and comprehensive documentation that explains the application's features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any
additional information required for users to understand and utilize the password manager effectively.
